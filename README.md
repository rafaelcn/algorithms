# Algorithms

In this repository there are algorithms going from data structures to sort
algorithms which are somewhat related, as they, both, act as technology
following Cormen.

The implementation of the algorithms, although mainly in C, are not bound to
one language only. You may /c/ (heh, you got it?) some other languages. Pull
requests and bug issues are welcome.

Furthermore, the algorithms implemented here might be very inefficient and
they have not been tested with large instances, you've been warned.
