The list of structures implemented in this repository is:

* Stack
* Queue
* Circular Queue
* Linked List
* Double Linked List
* Binary Trees

Stacks and Queues are just specialization of lists and are only implemented
with static allocation.

###  One more thing

There are other structures that were implemented as University 
homework, you can find them in the `src/uni/` folder.
