# Algorithms

In this repository there are algorithms going from data structures to sort
algorithms which are somewhat related, as they, both, act as technology
following Cormen.

The implementation of the algorithms, although mainly in C, are not bound to one
language only. You may /c/ (heh, you got it?) some other languages and pull
requests are welcome.

###  One more thing

There are other structures that were implemented as University
homework, you can find them in the `src/data structures/uni/` folder.
